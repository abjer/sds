    ">2. Do the same instead using all 2766607 road segments in California as your input. Go to [this site](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/SNAP/roadNet-CA.html) and download the data in Matrix Market format (`.mtx`). Unzip the file and remove the first 50 lines from it, since that is just markup that we don't need. The file is pretty big so you can expect it to take some time (~4 minutes on my computer). Report the number you get.\n",

    ">*Hint: Counting triangles is equivalent to counting \"common friends\". One way to do that is to just count the collective number of common friends that exist in a network. Depending on your implementation you might want to correct your result by a factor 3, since it is likely that you end up counting each triangle three times (one for each point in it).*\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Nerdy sidenote: Why would anyone want to count triangles??? Well, in network science there is a lot of statistical measures that include the count of triangles in a network. For example, the [clustering coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient), which reveals the proportion of small closed loops in a network, is computed as the number of realized triangles divided by the number of possible triangles.*"
